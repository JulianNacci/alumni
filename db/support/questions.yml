- title: 'Rails DB Migration - How To Drop a Table?'
  content: |
  I added a table that I thought I was going to need, but now no longer plan on using it. How should I remove that table?
  \
  I've already ran migrations, so the table is in my database. I figure `rails generate migration` should be able to handle this, but I haven't figured out how yet.
  \
  I've tried
  `rails generate migration drop_tablename`, but that just generated an empty migration.

    React-select cannot find React:
    TypeError: React is undefined1 react-select.js:826:4
    \
    React-select.js is getting react through
    \
        var React = (window.React);
    It lookes like i have to include React in the html to make this work, but i would like to avoid this. Is there something i am missing?
